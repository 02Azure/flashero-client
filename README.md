# Flashero - Simple Flash Card App

Flashero is a simple flashcard app inteded for helping memorizing things. Some of flashcard usual use are but not limited to: languange learning, memorizing-based lesson such as history/economy, etc. Flashero is basically just an app version of that but with a twist you can gain XP to level up your character each time you answered your card right! 

There is also a mastery system where a flashcard will appear less frequently the higher its mastery. Mastery level is increased everytime you can answer it with a 'good' mark. That means a higher mastery level, the better your understanding with that card ( Only if you pick the answer honestly ofc ). The higher mastery also means the higher XP gain on clear too! What if I somehow forget that card? picking 'again'
